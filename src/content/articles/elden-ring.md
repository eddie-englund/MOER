Elden Ring is the opposite of what modern gaming tries to be. Where you’re the hero to save the world,
or a great linear story where defeat isn’t something you’ll often find or settle with. It’s a dark and gritty world on the brink of destruction,
 and you’re the miserable fool on a pilgrimage to spare it, like so many before. A concept beautifully inherited by its predecessors, told differently.
\
\
It’s a world where victory feels like victory. Something you’ve struggled against for hours on end only to finally come out on top,
 a moment only outdone by the next colossal battle. Find yourselves in the Lands Between, a volatile realm faded from glory with the shattering. Create your Tarnished and fight your way against its many demigods, soldiers and creatures scattered across for you to find.
\
\
Be rewarded for your success in runes and utilize them to gain further power to ease your struggle. Discover spells and talismans,
scavenge armor sets and weapons in order to find your way to endure and vanquish the opposition.
Recover lost stories of the people who once remained or help those who yet are. While it won’t be easy,
try as you might to recover all the shards of the Elden Ring and claim your rightful title as Elden Lord.
