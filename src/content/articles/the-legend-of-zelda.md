Zelda has always been known for its purest sense of adventure, the idea of finding a sword only to dive head first into whatever you
find with it. It’s the dream of a child in their back garden or the local woods, blown into epic proportions as you explore a world
so vast that it would take days to know it all. And for the first time in forever, the next generation of zelda has finally been realized and released.
\
\
Head out on a grand journey into the ancient past of Hyrule, the first fully open world game of its legacy. Seek and solve as you complete
puzzles and dungeons scattered across the land. Fighting enemies with tools and temporary equipment which in turn leaves you with better
equipment for the next engagement. Face new and iconic enemies along your path as you travel and find chests for your troubles.
\
\
experience and experiment with tools and gadgets around the world to best handle the situation. Seek out the numerous shrines, with its
own set of challenges and the treasure guarded within. Venture the lands for quests and follow your duty to save Hyrule once again.
Another great Nintendo release you don’t wanna miss!
