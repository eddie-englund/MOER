Final Fantasy VII: Remake is in essence what makes others of its kind pale in comparison. This game isn’t simply a next generation glow up or drawn out of the well for lack of inspiration. It’s a realization that takes that 1997 nostalgia and transforms it into something much more complete.

Take control of Cloud Strife, an ex-soldier, in a reinvisioned adventure of Midgar. Working together with the resistance group Avalanche, trying to loosen the grip Shinra has over mako production and its effects on the planet. Changing the flow of battle, the once renowned turn based combat has turned more fluid; mixing itself with action rpg elements while retaining the essential signature turn based moves. Seamlessly swap between characters and you use unique moves and spells to best handle your situation.

A shorter yet more detailed telling of the events, expanding upon what was left brief with gorgeous visuals and brilliant voice acting. Story still in the making, additional parts of this game will be released; giving all moments of this classic title the justice it truly deserved. Whether you’ve played the original or not, with so much improved it’s a game definitely worth experiencing.
