# Privacy policy

We simply do not store nor use your data unless absolutely required such as when signing in and or creating accounts on this website.
If you were to use an external OAuth provider (google, facebook, etc) then we can not gurantee that your're not being tracked,
but you won't be by us. In such cases it'll be by that third-party provider.

We will also never user any metric tool that can or does identify you, if we were to use any metrics collecting tool we'd use something that was 100% anonymous and this page
would become updated to let you know of such tools.
